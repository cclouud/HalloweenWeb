<h1 align="center">🎃 Halloween Web</h1>  
<p>A simple Halloween-themed website I designed for a school competition. It features a registration system and includes two JavaScript mini-games for users to enjoy (Note: The mini-games are designed for PC, so they are not responsive).</p>  

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project  
To run this project correctly, follow these steps:  
1. Make sure you have **XAMPP** installed and running.  
2. Open the file **`php/login.php`** in your browser through XAMPP.  
3. Enjoy the website and mini-games!  

## 🚀 Deployment with Netlify
You can also access the project online through this link: [My domain](https://halloweenweb.cclouud.dev/).  
Note: Since Netlify doesn't support PHP at runtime, the site links directly to the `index.html` version, which includes only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
